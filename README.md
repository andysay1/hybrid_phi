# hybrid_phi

**High-precision φ-based approximation and memory routing for signal processing, AI, and embedded systems.**

`hybrid_phi` is a modular Rust library that provides accurate φ-based encoding, reversible approximation, quantized memory storage, routing, and exportable memory bundles.

---

## ✨ Features

-   ✅ **Reversible φ-based approximation** with sub-ε precision
-   ✅ **Quantized signal memory** with optional metadata
-   ✅ **Similarity-based routing**
-   ✅ **Self-contained bundles** (`.json` import/export)
-   ✅ **CLI examples** (`phi_app.rs`) for encoding, routing, listing, and more
-   ✅ **No-alloc friendly core**, minimal dependencies

---

## 📦 Installation

In your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hybrid_phi = "1.0.0"
```

---

## 🔧 Basic Usage

```rust
use hybrid_phi::hybrid_phi_approximate;

let x = 123.456;
let approx = hybrid_phi_approximate(x, 10);
```

For inverse:

```rust
use hybrid_phi::hybrid_phi_inverse;

let recovered = hybrid_phi_inverse(approx, 10);
```

---

## 🧠 Signal Memory + Routing

Store and route signals:

```rust
use hybrid_phi::phi_fs::PhiMemoryStore;
use hybrid_phi::phi_router::phi_route;

let store = PhiMemoryStore::new(".phi_store");
store.save("pattern1", &[1.0, 2.0, 3.0])?;

let route = phi_route(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], &store, 0.9);
```

---

## 📤 Bundles and Export

```rust
use hybrid_phi::phi_bundle::PhiBundle;

let bundle = PhiBundle::from_store("signal", &store)?;
bundle.save_json("signal.json")?;

let loaded = PhiBundle::load_json("signal.json")?;
loaded.save_to_store(&store)?;
```

---

## 🚀 CLI Examples

Run from examples:

```bash
cargo run --example phi_app encode my_signal
cargo run --example phi_app route --input=1.0,2.0,3.0 --threshold=0.9
cargo run --example phi_app export my_signal --to=my_signal.json
```
